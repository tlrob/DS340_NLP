Semester Project Write-up 

Throughout the course of this semester, I will seek to break down the linguistics and design of Magic: the Gathering trading cards in hopes of discovering what, if anything, can be attributed to its thirty-year longevity and success. I hope to find trends of game design throughout the three decades of development and refining. I also want to investigate how its players discuss the game both amongst themselves online and to non-players through promotional writing. 

TODO - will become more detailed as time goes on and I learn techniques. <br>
Create dataset of card data, scrape web for discussion.<br>
Preprocess data, split into desired categories (year, color, popularity, etc.) <br>
perform desired analysis <br>
